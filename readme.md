## Contributing

This project uses
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the
['Code-Editor'](http://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-code-editor-theme/) theme,
I'm happy to publish any guest posts or collaborate on improving the notes
in their current form. A good way to start is by opening an Issue or submitting
a work-in-progress PR. Cheers! :beers:
